                        boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her,

                        took a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her.

                    <p>
                        All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow
                        up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old
                        she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran
                        with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather
                        delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, “Oh,
                        why can’t you remain like this for ever!” This was all that passed
                        between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must
                        grow up.

                    <p>For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would be able to keep her, 
                        as she was another mouth to feed. Mr. Darling was frightfully proud of her, 
                        but he was very honourable.</p>

                            “It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,” Wendy said, sighing.

                            She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter sometimes.
